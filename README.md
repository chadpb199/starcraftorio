After a wacky waltz with a wandering wormhole, Nauvis was somehow transported to the Koprulu Sector!

This is a Factorio mod that replaces some in-game sounds and music with those from StarCraft.

This is a work in progress. What started as an interest in having StarCraft music play in-game has quickly turned into much more.
I am thinking about adding more StarCraft functionality to Factorio (e.g. resources, units, buildings, etc.), but that is a pretty ambitious goal.

Please don't sue me, Blizzard.
